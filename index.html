  <h3>The Journey</h3>
  <p class="plaintext">
    In the frozen lands of the <b>Abyss</b>, where the wind howled like the cries of lost souls and the snow blinded
    even the
    bravest warriors, a legend was born.
    <br><br>
    For centuries, the <b>Frost Wyvern</b>, a beast of unimaginable size and ferocity, ruled the icy peaks. Its scales
    shimmered
    like frozen diamonds, and its breath froze entire armies in their tracks. Many warriors had ventured to its lair
    atop
    Mount Cryoss, seeking glory, riches, or vengeance. None returned.
    <br>
    But Hex was different.
    <br><br>
    Hex was no ordinary fighter. Born into the harsh tundras, he grew up battling both the elements and the
    predators that roamed the frozen plains. With hair as white as snow and eyes that burned with a fierce amber light,
    he
    had earned his name after his unmatched ability to superior his enemies with cunning tactics and sheer willpower.
    <br><br>
    Word spread across the land of Hex’s intent to face the <strong>Frost Wyvern</strong>. Many mocked him, claiming
    <q>he was no different
      from the hundreds who had perished before him</q>. Yet, there was something about the way Hex carried himself
    calm,
    determined, and unshaken, that silenced doubters... &#128509

  <h3>Words of wisdom</h3>
  <p class="plaintext">
    Should thee seek audience with my humble self, let thy words traverse the winds of time. Cast thy message upon
    parchment
    or through the ether, and it shall find its way to me. Fear not, for no query is too bold, no thought too fleeting.
    <br><br>
    Speak, and I shall answer be it with wisdom, counsel, or the tales thou dost desire.
